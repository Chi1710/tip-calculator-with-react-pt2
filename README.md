This WebApp is baseoff on the tip-calculator-with-react and tip-calculator-js. 

I took what I learn from my 1st react tip calculator and build my own version plus some extra features.  

Language used : Javascript, React.js, CSS. 

User can input Bill, set tip percentage and Number of people to calculate total tip, tip per person and total per person. 


*very similar css styling to tip-calculator-with-js
